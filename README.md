Assessment topic: Create an MVC web application
Task Details: You are appointed as a web developer to develop a system to support managing memberships for a gym. The gym offers several types of memberships, including monthly, quarterly, and yearly, and several types of classes and training sessions. Your task is to design and develop a membership management system that allows members and gym staff to manage memberships and classes.
The application should enable users, whether members or gym staff, to access the system and manage memberships. Each member or staff can store personal details, including name, contact information, and login credentials. You must implement advanced web security techniques to store passwords.
The gym staff must be able to create, edit, or delete memberships and the list of classes and training sessions offered. However, members should only be able to see and manage their own memberships and class schedules. The application should create a summary report about the types of memberships and the number of members enrolled in each type.
The system should allow members to sign up for classes and training sessions, and view their schedule. The gym staff should be able to manage class schedules, set class limits, and track attendance.
Specific requirements:
Model Design Requirements:
• Design your entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for the classes based on your understanding of complex entity relationships, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
• The web application should store the information of every class and relationship using forms. For example, the Person class may have properties such as ID, Name, DOB, etc.
• Use appropriate data annotation and input validations for the HTML elements in the MVC forms. You can either use custom or default error messages.
Application Requirements:
• Create an ASP.net MVC web application.
• The home page must show group details, including student ID and student full names, in a table.
• Create model classes that are specific to ERD
• All the pages should have a logo and a navigation menu.
• Use CSS to use your custom design for the web pages.
• The web application must be ready to run without any additional configurations.
