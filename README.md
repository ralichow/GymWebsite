# GymWebsite


This is a Gym membership management Website that I built with my group mates for a project in a course.
It showcases the development of a dynamic website using ASP.NET Data Controls. It demonstrates proficiency in designing, testing, and maintaining a dynamic Internet application for business using a comprehensive suite of software tools.

As a web developer, I was tasked with creating a system to manage memberships for a gym, encompassing various membership types such as monthly, quarterly, and yearly subscriptions, along with diverse classes and training sessions. The system allows both members and gym staff to efficiently manage memberships and classes. Users can store personal details securely, including name, contact information, and login credentials, with advanced web security techniques implemented for password storage.

Key features include:

Creation, modification, and deletion of memberships and class lists by gym staff.
Member access restricted to viewing and managing their own memberships and class schedules.
Generation of summary reports detailing membership types and enrollment statistics.
Sign-up functionality for classes and training sessions, with members able to view their schedules.
Class schedule management, including setting limits and tracking attendance.

Specific requirements fulfilled:

*Entity-relationship diagram (ERD) designed to represent complex entity relationships.
*Storage of information using MVC forms with appropriate data annotations and input validations.
*Development of an ASP.NET MVC web application.
*Home page displaying group details in a table format.
Custom model classes tailored to the ERD.
Integration of a logo and navigation menu across all pages.
Custom CSS design for web page aesthetics.
Configuration-free deployment of the web application.
This project not only showcases technical proficiency but also emphasizes effective design, usability, and security in developing a robust solution for managing gym memberships and classes.
